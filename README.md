# To-Do
A repository to help me make another repository represeting my profile on GitHub

today - 23/01/2022


## Basic Idea
My exam is on 30Jan (Maths2 and Stats2) and I have a lot of things in my mind which I consider "I Should Do". I'm gonna jot down all the stuffs as they come up to my head so that I could at least study without bothering about anything and whenever something comes up to my head, this repo will get another commit.



## To-DOs

- [ ] **MUSIC PLAYER** - `Change music player library from yt-dl to yt-dlp` - I guess my "Music Player" is working slow because the API I am using on the raspberry pi is very-very slow. Few days back I was making a youtube playlist downloader, i stumbled upon this error of very slow download speeds, on extensive research I found that the reason was exactly why the Groovy and Rythm bot had to shut their Youtube links service(Legal Notice to discontinue YT-DL and all its public/private forks). Research Thread - [30102](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30102) which is a duplicate of [29326](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/29326) solution to which is simply shifting the library from `yt-dl` to `yt-dlp`. I am still not sure if this works or not but still I'm gonna try it.

- [ ] **RF Alarm** - `Order a RF Module for Raspberry Pi and study my Doorbell` - Out of the blue one idea came to my head that my doorbell operates wirelessly, read its manual and found out that it operates on Radio Freqencies. I remembered one guy made a radio broadcasting station on youtube, and I too did it, was easy enough. So if I could somehow get the frequency in which the doorbell operates I could maybe replicate. On a bit of research, I think that I'll be buying a RF Module for my Raspberry-Pi and will be reading the frequency and then emmiting the same in order to ring the doorbell.




### Will add more when I get time.
