# To-Do
A repository to help me make another repository represeting my profile on GitHub

today - 23/01/2022


## Basic Idea
My exam is on 30Jan (Maths2 and Stats2) and I have a lot of things in my mind which I consider "I Should Do". I'm gonna jot down all the stuffs as they come up to my head so that I could at least study without bothering about anything and whenever something comes up to my head, this repo will get another commit.



## To-DOs

- [ ] **MUSIC PLAYER** - `Change music player library from yt-dl to yt-dlp` - I guess my "Music Player" is working slow because the API I am using on the raspberry pi is very-very slow. Few days back I was making a youtube playlist downloader, i stumbled upon this error of very slow download speeds, on extensive research I found that the reason was exactly why the Groovy and Rythm bot had to shut their Youtube links service(Legal Notice to discontinue YT-DL and all its public/private forks). Research Thread - [30102](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30102) which is a duplicate of [29326](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/29326) solution to which is simply shifting the library from `yt-dl` to `yt-dlp`. I am still not sure if this works or not but still I'm gonna try it.

- [ ] **RF Alarm** - `Order a RF Module for Raspberry Pi and study my Doorbell` - Out of the blue one idea came to my head that my doorbell operates wirelessly, read its manual and found out that it operates on Radio Freqencies. I remembered one guy made a radio broadcasting station on youtube, and I too did it, was easy enough. So if I could somehow get the frequency in which the doorbell operates I could maybe replicate. On a bit of research, I think that I'll be buying a RF Module for my Raspberry-Pi and will be reading the frequency and then emmiting the same in order to ring the doorbell.

- [ ] **Newsletter** - `Order a RF Module for Raspberry Pi and study my Doorbell` - 'General Observation' while visiting good websites, I often came across these "Newsletter" thingy and though why can't my club [Pichavaram Coding Club](https://codingclub.pichavaram.in) or [Bibliophiles](https://bibliophiles.pichavaram.in) have their own custom Newsletter as well. Whe thinking for the mechanisms, one possible mechanism that cam to my head was.
 >-  Add a subscribe button to both webistes and save user's email into my API
 >-  Then use our [Custom Mail Portal](https://portal.pichavaram.in) to send bulk emails.

>While doing this all I though how these big websites would send their bulk mails and was reminded of a video that discussed bulk mailing plugins for Wrodpress websites.
On research I found [Some Wordpress Newsletter Plugins](https://wpmailsmtp.com/wordpress-newsletter-plugins/) and found [this one](https://wordpress.org/plugins/newsletter/) eye catchy. Will do further research later.

>Couple things I could do:
>- Update your mailing lists
>- Research on good newsletters

### Will add more when I get time.
